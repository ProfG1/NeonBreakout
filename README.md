Not that Important Notes:
I'm thinking a CDDA game in terms of depth with the POV similar to Project Zomboid, which is an isometric game. If the POV is hard to get, we could try the Soul knight approach for the POV. Give me your thoughts. It will be CDDA game but only in depth, the survival aspects will be not as important. It will be a dungeon crawler, rougelike; where the goal is to reach the bottom of a lab to self destruc to prevent the abominations from escaping. It will be scifi with fantasy and you can customize your character like CDDA and i'm thinking a top down view similar to alien shooter 2 and project zomboid.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
Im transferring all the animations to animation player instead of animated sprites and animation tree. Keep that in mind
Frank give me your discord, we need to communicate better than writing in the readme.

Is this good to merge??
